# Goals and Acknowledgements

### How did I get here? 

This actually isn't my first shot at a blog. My first attempt was on Blogger back in 2008 or so. Getting back in the saddle has been a long-term goal. I'm excited to get started and looking forward to building momentum. Other fine data scientists have better explained the many reasons for blogging. I saw David Robinson articulate the benefits of a blog in his talk at RStudioConf 2019 [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Public Work](https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioconf-2019/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-public-work/). Rachel Thomas wrote [Why you (yes you) should blog](https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045) over three years ago. Rachel also wrote an outstanding post, [Advice for Better Blog Posts](https://www.fast.ai/2019/05/13/blogging-advice/). Thank you to David, Rachel and the many other fine examples of quality blogging I've seen over the years. 

The critical difference this time around was overcoming the technical hurdles. After years of owning my own domain and maintaining a simple static page in various forms, it all came together. For that, I'd like to thank Jeremy Howard and the crew at fast.ai. The [dead simple process](https://www.fast.ai/2020/01/16/fast_template/) gets you started using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and even [ties in a custom domain](https://www.fast.ai/2020/01/18/gitblog/). You can be up and running in no time. Highly recommended if you have any interest in blogging but are wary of the mechanics. 

### What Should readers expect? 

Expect a stream of new learnings, projects and old tricks that feel worthy of being made public. Data science and machine learning are such fast moving fields that it feels hard to stay in touch with what's new. This will be my effort to motivate, document and demonstrate the things I learn. 

### Flow

Choosing data science projects can be intimidating. Trying to set a schedule for posts is stressful and I have enough writing deadlines in my day job. I want to prioritize flow, as explained by [Jonathan Hey](https://sketchplanations.com/flow), Chief Product Officer at Zen Educate and author of [Sketchplantations](https://sketchplanations.com/about). I am especially fond of the analogy below. I'm excited to start the climb. See you again soon. 

*When climbing, a prototypical flow activity, it's clear that you are trying to get to the top, you can immediately see if you are making progress and whether an action progressed you or not, and it's wise to pick a wall that is difficult but not impossible, for you to enjoy it.*
